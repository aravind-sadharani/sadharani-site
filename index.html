    <h2>What is Sadharani?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Sadharani aims to use technology to document and present Indian Classical music in a transparent and approachable manner.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Indian Classical Music</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      Indian Classical music is known by its performances and musical works, but there is much more to it. It is an ecosystem of people including students, artists, instrument makers, concert organizers, content producers and patrons. Many of its principles are age old, and yet it is an evolving and contemporary system of music. Despite being traditional in character, Indian Classical music has accepted and used technological advances to solve musical problems and improve musical capability.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Our Goals</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      We would like to make Indian Classical music accessible to a wide audience. We believe that ultimately music is a human connection between the artist and listeners. We would like to make listeners feel at ease and relish the music, by creating high fidelity recordings which capture its full richness and dynamics. For inquisitive members of our audience, we would like to create material, demonstrations and tools that shed light on the ecosystem, principles and traditions of Indian Classical music. We believe in making the best use of technology for all these goals.
