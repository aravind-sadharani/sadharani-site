    <h2>What is Sadharani?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Sadharani aims to use technology to document and present Indian Classical music in a transparent and approachable manner. Indian Classical music is known by its performances and musical works, but there is much more to it. It is an ecosystem of people including students, artists, instrument makers, concert organizers, content producers and patrons. Many of its principles are age old, and yet it is an evolving and contemporary system of music. Despite being traditional in character, Indian Classical music has accepted and used technological advances to solve musical problems and improve musical capability.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Despite the vast depth of Indian Classical music, we believe that music is ultimately a human connection between the artist and the listener. We would like to provide everything a listener may need to understand and appreciate it, but avoid adding anything inessential. We believe in making the best use of technology for creating good quality music recordings, for making tools for understanding and supporting music, for creating transparency in music through necessary documentation and for expanding its reach to a wide audience.
