    <h2>What is Sadharani?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Why do we appreciate music? Is it the same reason we create it? Perhaps that is why a work of music can speak for itself, if it is just brought face to face with listeners. At Sadharani, we want to bring music to listeners.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Sadharani is a belief. That music is a human connection between the artist and the listener. The grammar of music is a reference but a work of music is an expression. The authenticity of musical expression relies on the transparency of the medium.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Sadharani is a process. To present music and make it accessible. It is to presume nothing, to provide everything a listener may need to understand and appreciate it, but to add nothing inessential.
